# Remote controlled robot

In this challenge, the student sets up two Microbit boards: one is controlling motors on a robot vehicle, and the other one is attached to a joystic or control buttons.

The first task is to design a communication protocol: the controller may send the motor speed commands, or something more abstract, like speed and direction commands.

Then, both boards are programmed according to the protocol.

Additional task: the vehicle can be equipped with a distance sensor, and every time it approaches an obstacle, the robot sends back a signal to the controller, and the controller starts beeping or vibrating (depending on what hardware is available).
