# Fitness counter for micro:bit

In this project, micro:bit needs to be attached to a battery. There are several options on the market where the board is equipped with a wrist strap and a button cell battery. There could also be other combinations.

Task: the user presses the button while doing excercises. The board beeps with a short tone on every button press, and plays a special tone on every 10th pressing. The display can also show a counter of digits 9 to 0.

The standard "On Button" event in Scratch will react on releasing the button, which is inconvenient for the user. The challenge is to make it beep on button pressing, and not on releasing.
