# Micro:bit shooter game

The top row of the 5x5 LED matrix is displaying the target: a dot moving a) from left to right; b) left and right, bouncing from the walls.

The bottom row displays the cannon. It moves with a constant speed from left to right.

On button press, the cannon shoots a projectile which is flying from the bottom row to the top. The cannon continues moving. If the projectile hits the target, play the music.

Alternatively, connect additional buttons or a joystic to the micro:bit, and control the cannon moves and shooting.
