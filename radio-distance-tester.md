# Micro:bit radio distance tester

Two micro:bit boards, programmed to send periodic signals to each other. Upon receiving the signal from the other side, the board plays a beep.

The students explore how far the boards can see each other, and how obstacles are reducing the distance. Try placing the human body in line of the signal.
